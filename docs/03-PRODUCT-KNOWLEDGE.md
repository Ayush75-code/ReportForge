## 3. TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### CSV Upload Issues

**Issue 1: "Missing required columns"**
*   **Cause:** Meta Ads export didn't include CPA or Conversions.
*   **Fix:** In Ads Manager: Columns -> Customize -> Select "Conversions", "CPA", "CPC" -> Apply -> Export.

**Issue 2: "Invalid data in row X"**
*   **Cause:** Currency symbols ("$100") or text in number fields.
*   **Fix:** Open CSV, format columns as "Number" (no $), save.

**Issue 3: File size too large (>10MB)**
*   **Cause:** Exporting years of data or thousands of campaigns.
*   **Fix:** Export last 30 days only OR filter campaigns before export.

### Report Generation Issues

**Issue 4: Stuck in "Processing"**
*   **Cause:** AI timeout or network glich.
*   **Fix:** Wait 5 mins. If still stuck, delete and re-upload.

**Issue 5: Generic Analysis**
*   **Cause:** Data lacks clear patterns (all campaigns performed identically).
*   **Fix:** Edit analysis manually to add context, or upload more data (longer date range).

**Issue 6: PDF Generation Fails**
*   **Cause:** Logo URL broken or Special Characters in text.
*   **Fix:** Re-upload logo (PNG). Remove emojis from analysis text.

### Account Issues

**Issue 7: Payment Declined**
*   **Fix:** Check card expiry. Call bank to authorize "ReportForge via Stripe".

**Issue 8: Account "Suspended"**
*   **Cause:** Unpaid bill or Terms violation.
*   **Fix:** Update payment method in Settings -> Billing.
