## FIRST: READ THE DOCUMENTATION

4. docs/10-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md     → Colors, typography, components
5. docs/01-SYSTEM-PROMPTS.md    → AI agent specifications (CSV, Analysis, PDF)

REFERENCE AS NEEDED:

## CRITICAL RULES (Always Follow)

1. **Product Name:** Always use "ReportForge" (never "InsightEngine")
2. **Plain Text Output:** AI-generated text must NOT contain markdown (`**bold**`, `_italic_`), LaTeX, or symbols
3. **Human-in-the-Loop:** Users MUST review/edit AI analysis before PDF generation
4. **Type Safety:** All code must be TypeScript with proper types
5. **Error Logging:** Log issues to `ERRORS.md` with resolutions
6. **Progress Tracking:** Update `PROGRESS.md` after completing each task
7. **Deferred Branding:** Users generate first report BEFORE adding logo
8. **Performance Score:** AI must output a 0-100 score answering "Is it good or bad?"
9. **Doc References:** Read relevant docs before implementing each feature

         quick_summary, summary, wins, concerns, recommendations, 
         personal_note, pdf_url, csv_data, date_range_start, date_range_end)

## AI AGENT OUTPUT SCHEMA

**→ Full details in `docs/01-SYSTEM-PROMPTS.md`**

When implementing AI analysis (Agent 2), output must be:

```json
{
  "performance_score": 82,
  "score_label": "Strong Performance",
  "quick_summary": "Spent $2,450, generated 89 conversions at $27.53 CPA.",
  "summary": "This month showed strong results...",
  "wins": ["Win 1 with specific numbers", "Win 2", "Win 3"],
  "concerns": ["Concern 1 with data", "Concern 2"],
  "recommendations": ["Action 1", "Action 2", "Action 3"]
}
```

**Remember:** Plain text only. No markdown formatting.
