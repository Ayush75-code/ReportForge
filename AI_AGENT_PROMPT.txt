## 🚀 INITIAL PROMPT (Copy This First)

```
You are a Senior Full-Stack Developer building ReportForge, a B2B SaaS app for marketing agencies.

**ReportForge** transforms Meta Ads CSV exports into AI-powered, branded PDF reports in under 60 seconds.

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI
- Backend: Supabase (Auth, PostgreSQL, Storage), OpenAI API (gpt-4o-mini)
- PDF: @react-pdf/renderer
- Payments: Stripe

**Before writing any code, read the documentation files in this order:**
1. START_HERE.md (this file)
2. docs/06-PRD-FULL.md (product requirements)
3. docs/07-MVP-SPECIFICATION.md (MVP scope)
4. docs/08-SYSTEM-ARCHITECTURE.md (tech architecture)
5. docs/10-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md (visual design)
6. docs/01-SYSTEM-PROMPTS.md (AI agent prompts for CSV/Analysis/PDF)

**Key Design Decisions (from Market Research):**
- Performance Score (0-100) answers "Is it good or bad?" at a glance
- Quick Summary: Single-sentence scannable overview
- Personal Note: Optional human touch before PDF export
- Deferred Branding: Users generate first report BEFORE adding logo
- Plain Text Only: AI outputs no markdown (**bold**), LaTeX, or symbols

**Current Task:** [DESCRIBE WHAT YOU WANT TO BUILD]

Please confirm you've understood the project context and are ready to proceed.

## 📋 FOLLOW-UP PROMPTS (Use As Needed)

### Starting a New Feature
```
I want to implement [FEATURE NAME] from docs/06-PRD-FULL.md.

Please:
1. Review the feature requirements in the PRD
2. Check the relevant architecture in docs/08-SYSTEM-ARCHITECTURE.md
3. Follow the design system in docs/10-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md
4. Create the necessary files and components
5. Update PROGRESS.md when complete
```

### Fixing a Bug
```
I'm experiencing this issue: [DESCRIBE BUG]

Please:
1. Diagnose the root cause
2. Check if this relates to any documented behavior in docs/
3. Implement a fix
4. Log the issue and resolution in ERRORS.md
```

### Implementing AI Analysis (Agent 2)
```
Implement the Meta Ads Performance Analyst agent from docs/01-SYSTEM-PROMPTS.md.

Critical requirements:
- Output Performance Score (0-100) with label (Strong/Moderate/Needs Attention)
- Output Quick Summary (single sentence)
- Output: summary, 3 wins, 2 concerns, 3 recommendations
- PLAIN TEXT ONLY - no markdown, no **bold**, no _italic_, no LaTeX
- Use gpt-4o-mini with temperature 0.3
- Response format: JSON
```

### Implementing PDF Generation (Agent 3)
```
Implement the PDF Report Generator from docs/01-SYSTEM-PROMPTS.md.

Critical requirements:
- Include Performance Score Badge in header
- Include Quick Summary highlighted box
- Include Personal Note section (if provided)
- Use agency branding (logo, color) or defaults
- A4, Portrait, 40pt margins
- Use @react-pdf/renderer
```

### Implementing CSV Validation (Agent 1)
```
Implement the CSV Validator Agent from docs/01-SYSTEM-PROMPTS.md.

Required columns (case-sensitive):
- Campaign Name, Impressions, Clicks, Spend, Conversions, CPC, CTR, CPA

Validation rules:
- Reject if missing columns (list which ones)
- Reject if zero spend
- Warn if low impressions (<1000)
- Parse with PapaParse
```

### Creating UI Components
```
Create the [COMPONENT NAME] component following docs/10-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md.

Design requirements:
- Use Shadcn/UI base components
- Colors: Primary (Indigo-600), Success (Emerald-600), Warning (Amber-500), Error (Rose-600)
- Font: Inter
- Cards: White bg, Slate-200 border, Shadow-sm, Rounded-lg
- Buttons: Primary (Indigo-600), Secondary (White/Slate border)
```

### Database/Supabase Work
```
I need to work on the database schema for [TABLE/FEATURE].

Please reference:
- docs/08-SYSTEM-ARCHITECTURE.md for schema definitions
- Use Supabase migrations
- Implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Test queries before committing
```

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULES (Always Follow)

1. **Product Name:** Always use "ReportForge" (never "InsightEngine")
2. **Plain Text:** AI outputs must NOT contain markdown, LaTeX, or formatting symbols
3. **Human-in-the-Loop:** Users MUST review/edit analysis before PDF generation
4. **Branding:** Deferred until after first successful report
5. **Error Logging:** Log all issues to ERRORS.md
6. **Progress Tracking:** Update PROGRESS.md after completing tasks
7. **Type Safety:** All code must be TypeScript with proper types
8. **No Placeholders:** Generate actual working code, not pseudocode
